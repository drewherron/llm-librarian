Only organize books about programming. Skip all other types of books.
Organize them into directories named after the programming language (e.g., "Python", "JavaScript", "C++").
Use the following format for filenames (where possible): {title} - {author} - {year}
If the book discusses multiple programming languages, categorize it under the primary language.
If it's a general programming book not specific to a language, use "Programming" as the category.
For web development books, use the primary technology (e.g., "React", "Django") as the subcategory within the language.
For cloud platforms, the directory might be "AWS", "GCP", "Azure", etc.
